# Simple Dotfile Management

Just a simple way to manage dotfiles, very derivative, i'm sure.

I Wrote **make-links.sh** in a few minutes, so there are likely some oversights, although in my minimal testing it seems fine.

## Install

Simply clone the repository and run the script:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/aloop/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
bash ~/.dotfiles/make-links.sh
```

## Usage

To re-link or add new links, simply run make-links.sh again:

```sh
bash ~/.dotfiles/make-links.sh
```
